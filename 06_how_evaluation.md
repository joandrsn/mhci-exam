# Question 6

## What kind of data can we collect in mHCI evaluations and how? 
* People's attitudes, beliefs and perceptions
* People's behaviors. We focus on past or future behavior
* People's facts and demographics
* People's performance


## Why do we collect such data, what is our purpose? 
To gather information about the user's perception of the solution. We as designers and programmers may have an one understanding of the user, but if the user has another perception, we may have to change our view of the user. To provide another aspect: re-evaluate our alignment with the user.

## Are there any differences between conducting evaluations in a lab and the field?

Yes of course there is. The user may feel intimidated by being in a lab, compared to the real world. The user may have issues imagineing their environment when they are in the lab.
