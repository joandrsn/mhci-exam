# Question 1

## How can we define and characterize mobile computing? Give examples of the different eras.

-   Connectivity: Calling, then 2g with text messages, then 3G, 4G, 5G.
-   Convergance: Collecting many things into one. Calendar + Mail +
    Later: Music player, Video player, Approval system for National ID
    etc.
-   Apps: The fact that every mobile computer now has a app store. Apple
    App Store, Google Play, PlayStation Network etc.

## What is context and why is important for mobile computing?

## What is Big C and Small C?

-   **Big C**: Context, what do users need
-   **small c**: What is required to fulfil that

Further: ##\# Context (big c) - **The Problem** - What problems are you
trying to design a solution for? - What value do you want to bring for
your users? - **Users and their situation** - Who are your users and
what do you know about them? - How are they able to or how will they
interact with your design? - **Location** - What and where is it
happening? - **Markets** - How is your idea different from other design
already available?

### context (small c)

Which requirements / constraints lies in the context? - **Physical and
spatial considerations** - Are there any restrictions in the physical
environment or the location? (e.g. will I be able to use the design all
the time) - **Technological considerations** - How are different devices
present in different situations? (e.g. why smart watches might be better
than smart phones when running or swimming) -
**Psycological/demographical considerations** - Does users mental models
and prerequisites for interacting with certain devices (e.g. knowledge,
common conceptions in the community etc.)

## How can we communicate context to others?

Primary focus: Personas A description of fictional character which is
created in research. The character represents the different user types
that might user the service/product/site/etc in a similar way.

Personas help DESIGNERS understand users' needs, experiences, behaviours
and goals.

### Personas - fictional or real?

You should **always create personas from observations about real
users**. They should never be invented from assumptions about your
users.

# Question 2

## How can we collect data about the context of our idea?

-   Interviews: We ask deep
-   Questionnaires: We ask in general
-   Observation:

## Give examples of the different ways of communicating your idea to other team members/costumers/users?

Personas

# Question 3

## What is a digital ecosystem?

A network of nodes that interact with each other through relationships.
This network consists of users and a digital artifacts, dynamically
bounded by the users' activities.

## How can we classify interaction with multiple mobile devices in a digital ecosystem?

![](../figures/classify_interactions.png)

## Give short examples of the four categories of interaction (Collaboration, Communality, Complementarity, Continuity)

-   **Collaboration**
    -   
-   **Communality**
    -   
-   **Complementarity**
    -   
-   **Continuity**
    -   

# Question 4

## Why is it important for designers know the difference between devices and platforms when we design for them?

## What is skeuomorphism?

### Skeuomorphic Design

Term used for graphical user interface design to describe interface
objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear
and/or how the user can interact with them.

## How do we ensure that our design will fit into the mobile platform that we design for (e.g., Android, iOS)?

We uphold the guidelines set by the platform to ensure consistency.

# Question 5

## What is a prototype?

A prototype is a simple experimental model of a proposed solution used
to test or validate ideas, design assumptions and conceptualisation
quickly and cheaply.

## When in the design process do, we introduce prototypes?

In the prototyping phase - 3rd phase.

1.  Establishing Requirements
2.  Designing alternatives
3.  Prototyping
4.  Evaluating

![](../figures/process.png) ## Give examples of the different prototypes
and their strengths and weaknesses. ##\# Sketches - **Strengths**: Easy
to change, cheap, quick - **Weaknesses**: The user may have difficulty
imagining the final product?

### Software (e.g wireframe - Figma)

-   **Strengths**: Looks more like the final product.
-   **Weaknesses**: Requires more time compared to a lo-fidelity
    prototype

# Question 6

## What kind of data can we collect in mHCI evaluations and how?

-   People's attitudes, beliefs and perceptions
-   People's behaviors. We focus on past or future behavior
-   People's facts and demographics
-   People's performance

## Why do we collect such data, what is our purpose?

To gather information about the user's perception of the solution. We as
designers and programmers may have an one understanding of the user, but
if the user has another perception, we may have to change our view of
the user. To provide another aspect: re-evaluate our alignment with the
user.

## Are there any differences between conducting evaluations in a lab and the field?

Yes?

# Question 7

## Assume you have collected qualitative data. What is the process that you need to follow to conduct an analysis of this data?

Classify unstructured data into categoeries

1.  Define the dataset
2.  Clean up the dataset
3.  Code the dataset
4.  Extract findings

![](../figures/qualitative_data_analysis_process.png)

## What are the two approaches for coding qualitative data, and what are their differences?

-   Emergent coding
-   A priori coding

**Emergent coding** ![](../figures/emergent_coding.png) **A priori
coding** ![](../figures/a_priori_coding.png)

# Question 8

## What is a research hypothesis, and are there different types?

-   Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the conditions
-   Alternative hypothesis: There is difference between the conditions.

## What is the difference between independent and dependent variables?

-   Independent variable
    -   A variable we think is the cause
    -   A variable that is independent of a perticipant's behaviour
    -   A variable that we manipulate in our experiment
-   Dependent variable
    -   A variable we think is the effect, as it depends on the cause
    -   A variable that is dependent on a participant's behavior
    -   The variable that we measure in our experiment

In general: An independent variable has an effect on a dependent
variable. Examples: \* Education has an effect on IQ level \* Input
devices have an effect on efficiency

## What is the operational definition of a variable?

For a variable, we need a procedure to measure or manipulate it.
Example: Aggression: \* The number of times a kid hits a toy \* The
number of times a kid fights with another kid \* A score on a aggression
questionnaire

## How can we assess the quality of operational definitions?

dunno lul.

# Question 9

## What can be the sources of systematic errors in an experiment?

-   Participants
-   Researchers
-   Digital artifacts
-   Environment
-   Procedure
-   Measurement tools

## What can we do in order to minimize/eliminate them?

??

## Why is it important to pilot test?

-   Make sure that everything is working as expected
-   Make sure that the participants are influenced only by the
    independent variable among the conditions
-   Have preliminary findings that will tell us if we need more
    conditions, or a different setup.
-   Check the tasks we have designed for:
    -   Ceiling effect: Too easy task. All participants reach max
        performance
    -   Floor effect: Too difficult tasks. Noone performs well.

# Question 10

## What is the difference between basic and complex experiments in terms of number of variables and used statistical techniques?

-   Basic: One independent variable, minimum 2 levels
-   Complex: More than two independent variables. minimum 2 levels.

## What are the differences between between-subjects and within-subjects designs?

-   Between-
-   Between-group designs: Different participants experience the
    conditions ## What are their advantages and disadvantages?
