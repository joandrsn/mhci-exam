# Question 8
## What is a research hypothesis, and are there different types? 
* Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the conditions
* Alternative hypothesis: There is difference between the conditions.

## What is the difference between independent and dependent variables? 
* Independent variable
  * A variable we think is the cause
  * A variable that is independent of a perticipant's behaviour
  * A variable that we manipulate in our experiment
* Dependent variable
  * A variable we think is the effect, as it depends on the cause
  * A variable that is dependent on a participant's behavior
  * The variable that we measure in our experiment

In general:
An independent variable has an effect on a dependent variable. Examples:
* Education has an effect on IQ level
* Input devices have an effect on efficiency

## What is the operational definition of a variable? 
For a variable, we need a procedure to measure or manipulate it. 
Example:
Aggression:
* The number of times a kid hits a toy
* The number of times a kid fights with another kid
* A score on a aggression questionnaire

## How can we assess the quality of operational definitions?
dunno lul.
