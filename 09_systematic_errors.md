# Question 9

## What can be the sources of systematic errors in an experiment? 
* Participants
* Researchers
* Digital artifacts
* Environment

## What can we do in order to minimize/eliminate them? 
??

## Why is it important to pilot test?
* Make sure that everything is working as expected
* Make sure that the participants are influenced only by the independent variable among the conditions
* Have preliminary findings that will tell us if we need more conditions, or a different setup.
* Check the tasks we have designed for:
  * Ceiling effect: Too easy task. All participants reach max performance
  * Floor effect: Too difficult tasks. Noone performs well.
