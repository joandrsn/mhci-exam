# Question 1

## How can we define and characterize mobile computing? Give examples of the different eras. 

* Connectivity: Calling, then 2g with text messages, then 3G, 4G, 5G.
* Convergance: Collecting many things into one. Calendar + Mail + Later: Music player, Video player, Approval system for National ID etc.
* Apps: The fact that every mobile computer now has a app store. Apple App Store, Google Play, PlayStation Network etc.

## What is context and why is important for mobile computing? 


## What is Big C and Small C? 
- **Big C**: Context, what do users need
- **small c**: What is required to fulfil that

Further:
### Context (big c)
- **The Problem**
  - What problems are you trying to design a solution for?
  - What value do you want to bring for your users?
- **Users and their situation**
  - Who are your users and what do you know about them?
  - How are they able to or how will they interact with your design?
- **Location**
  - What and where is it happening?
- **Markets**
  - How is your idea different from other design already available?

### context (small c)
Which requirements / constraints lies in the context?
- **Physical and spatial considerations**
  - Are there any restrictions in the physical environment or the location? (e.g. will I be able to use the design all the time)
- **Technological considerations**
  - How are different devices present in different situations? (e.g. why smart watches might be better than smart phones when running or swimming)
- **Psycological/demographical considerations**
  - Does users mental models and prerequisites for interacting with certain devices (e.g. knowledge, common conceptions in the community etc.)

## How can we communicate context to others?
Primary focus: Personas
A description of fictional character which is created in research. 
The character represents the different user types that might user the service/product/site/etc in a similar way.

Personas help DESIGNERS understand users' needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.

### Personas - fictional or real?
You should **always create personas from observations about real users**. They should never be invented from assumptions about your users.
