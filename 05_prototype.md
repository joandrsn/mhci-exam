# Question 5

## What is a prototype? 
A prototype is a simple experimental model of a proposed solution used to test or validate ideas, design assumptions and conceptualisation quickly and cheaply.

## When in the design process do, we introduce prototypes? 
In the prototyping phase - 3rd phase.
1. Establishing Requirements
2. Designing alternatives
3. Prototyping
4. Evaluating
